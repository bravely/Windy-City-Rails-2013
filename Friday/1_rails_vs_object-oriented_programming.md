# Rails vs. Object-Oriented Programming
by [Noel Rappin (@noelrap)](http://www.twitter.com/noelrap)

### Structure vs. Simplicity

1. CGI Perl(Markup generated by a program)
2. Templating: PHP, ASP, ColdFusion(Markup that can use a program)
3. Java(Struts, ambitious web framework)
4. Him(The same things made over and over again, wanting to break things down to get simplicity back)
5. Rails 1.0 Released(Replaced a complicated structure with a very simple MVC structure)
6. Skinny Controller, Fat Model
7. Jay Fields, Presenter()
8. Rails 1.2 REST(Controllers should consistently have the same actions)(Service objects, Dependency injection: class treated as variable of another class that it has a relationship with)
9. Objects on Rails, Clean Ruby books
10. ???
11. Noel Explaints it All to Us: Math(Game Theory)!
	a. Do I add structure?
	b. Will I need the structure?
	c. Did I need it?
	d. Break even = (cost/savings)

#### You can't defeat complexity, you can only hope to contain it.

##### Reduce cognitive load.

**Meaningful names help a lot.**

### Testing is a legitimate engineering goal

"All these OO techniques feel like crazy overkill right up to the moment you wish you had started using them six months ago."
