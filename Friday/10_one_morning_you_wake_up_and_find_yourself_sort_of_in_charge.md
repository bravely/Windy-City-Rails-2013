##### Most seem to leave exclusively 'programming' later, into a leadership/management role.

### Programming moves into:
* Mastery
* Mentorship
* Management

#### …all three of these seem to lead to being 'in charge'. Or…
* in control
* responsible


## Sort of 'in charge'.
* Power & Control: The least important part of things. Your ability to actually use this is incredibly constrained.
* Saying things worth following. Your words end up having much more impact.
* Being a force multiplier. You make others be more impactful, and what you do has a lot more impact.
* Helping good collaboration happen. You have to work at this, it takes real skill, but it's very valuable to…

#### Getting things done you can't get done alone.
* Going from *writing code* to **helping others write code.**

### Communication Patterns
* Have some empathy.(or fake it by asking questions)
* Apply metaphors liberally. lolol.
* KISS: DO IT EVERY TIME.
* Don't waste time. Don't provide more information than is needed. Think about *what the other person needs to hear*. You don't have to say everything right now, they can ask questions later. They'll ask followup questions if they need to. Say the minimum you need to say, they'll ask a question that'll force you to answer it precisely.

### Improve your support stack
* Testing tools & practices
* Development environment & tools
* developer interfaces to your app
* deployment process
* docs & style guides

### Giving Great Code Review
* Use pull requests
* Join the right conversations
* Uphold standards(constructively)
* Nitpick(appropriately)
* Above all, be helpful


### Beware of Process Overhead
* Collective Process Ownership
* Lots of Guidelines, Few Rules
* Garbage collection, not enforcement: This is not about enforcing compliance, it's about helping fixes and guiding, great for backlog decisions and cleaning. Be very permissive about what you let in on the backlog, but make course corrections
* Have tools follow process
* Meetings are Tools


### Remember it's not about you
* Separate taste from judgment
* Watch out for biases
* "Feeling" productive can be bullshit
* When in doubt, talk about it

## Investment strategies for your political capitol

### Get in on grown-up meetings
Get in on discussions with those above the engineers

### Ask lots of questions. (Remember the empathy?)
There's a lot related to your job that isn't your job and you otherwise wouldn't hear about.

### Learn to take the long view.
When you're at a higher level, when you're architecting the system, you need to think a bit ahead of your project just so you can mitigate and head off problems, especially since you know the direction of the business because you know things the Engineers don't.

### Learn to sell your ideas.
Talk about benefits, costs, etc.

### Learn to think bigger(but realistically)
Think up to the bound of what your team is capable of. Know your limits, but get to them too.

### When the time comes, ask for the job you're(probably) already doing
You've been coordinating the team, knowing your stuff, putting your opinion out and being right. So ask for it. Be proper about it, get the pay and title and position you deserve

## A leader's first responsibility is to make sure your team has whatever it needs to be AWESOME
Make sure your team has what they need to do their best work.


# One More Thing
Wear sunscreen. Hahahahahahahahahahahaah

# Have fun.

### Doing work you hate hurts you.
Stress isn't fun. It doesn't work. It doesn't help your team. Love your job, love your work, love your product.

Why work hard on your stuff if you aren't enjoying it? This is important. Put yourself in places where you believe in what you're doing, and enjoy it.

### Get to know yourself.
What actually interests you? What do you ACTUALLY want to do?

## You want to get here:
* Something you love
* Something you're good at
* Something the world needs

Get between those three. Get in the center. Jeff Veen came up with this.

If you don't have to work hard at something, you stop enjoying it. But, if you can't ever get good at it, you just get really frustrated and drop it.

You want to find a good **Flow**: Giving yourself a challenge, getting better, and finding new challenges. Keep growing, keep becoming the next most valuable, find the next most interesting thing.

Where do you want to be in 20 years sucks.
