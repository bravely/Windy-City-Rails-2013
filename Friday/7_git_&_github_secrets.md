$750 million valuation on series a-round

## Git stuff

### Merge Strategies
`git merge master -s strategy`

`git merge master -s ours`
Long running branch that will supersede master.

`git merge master -s recursive -X patience`
better line matching for logical groups
Can also set as a global option. Makes merge smarter, but a bit slower

`man git-merge`

### Second Order Diff Trick
`git diff stash@{0}`
Good for find and replace in projects without worrying

emoji diffs

Git uses less as its pager

`git --no-pager diff`

`git stripspace`
Fixes horrible coworkers and contributors

Strips trailing whitespaceâ€¦ everywhere, can even pipe shit in
Run this in your editor after file saves

`git diff --check`
Fixes horrible you.

`git diff --cached`
git diff only diffs unstaged changes
Shows STAGED(but uncommitted) changes

`git merge --abort`
Aborts conflicted merge. Resets your tree.

`get merge -m`
MERGE MESSAGE FROM OUTSIDE EDITOR WOO

`git merge --no-message`
guess

`git status --ignored`
Shows the status of everything you're ignoring

`--assume-unchanged`
Temporarily ignore a file
`git update-index --assume-unchanged path_to_file`
`git update-index --assume-no-unchanged`

`git commit -m "fixes shit"` not in his mind
Good commits have:

* Short summary(title) under 50chars
* Longer description of the change that follows, around 72chars

## Github stuff
#####canonical URLs
press y on any page, creates canonical URL, won't change even if the branch does

##### curlable public keys
github.com/user.keys
Programmatically add SSH keys

##### fetching pulls
Accepting a Pull Request: Add a remote, fetch branch, merge, boring zzzz
`git fetch origin pull/id/head:name` or `git fetch origin pull/12/head:pr`, gets pull request 12, names it PR on your side

##### Live updates
Pull request pages have live updates

##### repo redirects
Rename your repository, will redirect old URLs
