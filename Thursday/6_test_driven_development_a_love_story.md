# Test Driven Development: A Love Story

Adding tests to legacy code takes time

"Take small steps that can be verified." - Noel Rappin

Any good code needs tests.

### Call new tested code from legacy code. This is how you start the transfer to tested code in a legacy environment.

Bugs in code **must be reproduced** in tests.

Use tests to **learn legacy code**.

Write failing test.

Make it go green.

######Refactor.

Never write new functionality without a failing test

""Testing is about trust." - Robert C. Martin

Production code doesn't go away, **changes will happen**.

Every line of **test** code is reliable code.

Every line of untested code is **unreliable** code.

Tests **prevent** breaking.

Tests are doumentation.

#### Write test names like they're documentation.

Tests **remove fear**.
